# Java-Sorting-Programs
This GitHub contains coding projects from my Software Design & Documentation course at Merrimack. The two Java programs read a list of integer numbers from user input, store them in different data structures, and sort them in ascending order.

## Programs

1. **SortedLinkedList.java**: 
   - Stores the integers in a `LinkedList` and sorts them using the Java Collections Framework.
   - The user can type "exit" to stop entering numbers.
   
2. **SortedStack.java**:
   - Stores the integers in a `Stack` and sorts them similarly using the Java Collections Framework.
   - The user can type "exit" to stop entering numbers.

### How to Compile and Run

1. **Compile the Programs**:
   ```bash
   javac SortedLinkedList.java
   javac SortedStack.java
